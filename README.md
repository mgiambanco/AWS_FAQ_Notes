# AWS_FAQ_Notes
In preparation for AWS SA, I've gone through the FAQs and attempted to distill them down to the most basic, easily study-able points.

I've attempted to only leave out anything related to billing as this is generally not presented in the exams and can change from time to time.

All the information came from the [AWS FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/faqs/)
